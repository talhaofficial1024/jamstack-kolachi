Thank you!</p> <p>Slack: <a href=\"https://join.slack.com/t/jamstack/shared_invite/zt-8nw6pmj5-sfla3J7jNBXhiL9ZDNdTtw\" class=\"linkified\">https://join.slack.com/t/jamstack/shared_invite/zt-8nw6pmj5-sfla3J7jNBXhiL9ZDNdTtw</a><br/>join #meetup-sfbayarea for community discussions live!</p> <p>Talk #1: Bryan Robinson</p> <p>The DIY Web: Where we came from; what we’ve lost; where we can go</p> <p>Society’s perception of the web has changed. What was once a DIY paradise has neatly converted itself into a commercial juggernaut. The web’s commercial power keeps us all well-employed, but what have we lost since the days of the DIY movement?<br/>In this talk, we’ll examine what has changed and how the Jamstack is positioning itself as a prime avenue to bring back personal projects, sites and apps in a big way.</p> <p>Bryan has been creating hand-crafted experiences on the web his entire career. His experience spans from large content-driven news sites to boutique designs for small to medium businesses.<br/>He’s currently making a living as a “free agent” developer evangelist for technologies he’s passionate about via his startup company Code Contemporary. In the past, he’s led agency design and development teams, been a front-end developer and a UX strategist.<br/>Bryan hosts the That’s My Jamstack podcasts, streams live code and design daily and runs multiple developer groups in his hometown.<br/>His passions on the web are CSS, layout and the Jamstack. He lives in Memphis with his wife, son and two cats.</p> <p>**************************************************************<br/>Talk #2: Lars Peterson</p> <p>Blazing fast Jamstack personalization<br/>It's a well-known fact that personalization can help increase engagement and conversions by giving site visitors a more relevant experience. In this session we dive into different types of personalization, ranging from easy to advanced, from rules-based to machine learning and how to use personalization on the Jamstack.</p> <p>Lars Birkholm Petersen is co-founder of Uniform, a platform enabling Jamstack for the Enterprise and co-author of Connect: How to Use Data and Experience Marketing to Create Lifetime Customers. He is an expert on advising enterprise organizations on data architecture and architecting personalized experiences.</p> <p>**************************************************************</p> ",
