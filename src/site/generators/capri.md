description: Build static sites with interactive islands.
---
Capri is a static site generator with a component-based workflow. Websites
built with Capri ship zero KB of JavaScript to the browser by default. You can
selectively add interactive islands that get hydrated when the page loads.
Capri supports live CMS previews by generating an SPA right next to the
static pages.
