description: The Joyful Site Generator. Islands of Interactivity with Vue, Preact, Svelte, and more.
---
Ã®les is a static-site generator with great support for partial hydration, supporting all major frameworks.

During development, build your site enjoying the smooth dx provided by Vite.

In production, ship JS only for the interactive bits. By default, that's zero.
