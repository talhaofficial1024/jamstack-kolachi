Stenope is a bundle & CLI tool for Symfony developers. 

## Philosophy and goals

Stenope was designed with these goals in mind:

- Stenope meets your needs, not the other way around. No structure nor format is imposed.
- Stenope runs in any Symfony project out of the box, connects with standard Symfony components and feels natural to Symfony developers.
- Stenope is highly extensible: features can be replaced, added or removed.

The bundle also comes with a handy set of content manager, providers & tools to help you generate pages from YAML, Markdown or JSON content files (or virtually any format supported by Symfony's Serializer or your owns).

## What Stenope is not
  
Stenope is not a ready-to-use blogging system: but you could quickly write your own blog system with it!
