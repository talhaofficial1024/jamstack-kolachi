### Why Payload?

Payload is a CMS that is obsessed with giving engineers the best developer experience possible to build out APIs and admin UI. It catapults developers' efficiency and value by delivering an extensible REST and GraphQL API as well as a beautiful React admin panel for non-technical users to manage contentâ€”all in TypeScript.

From docs to design, it's staunchly code-first, but uncompromising in admin experience. Developers finally have a tool to deliver their admins with a CMS that is beautiful, minimal, extensible, and usable. It can power the backend for websites of all sizes, ecommerce, SaaS, native apps, and more.
